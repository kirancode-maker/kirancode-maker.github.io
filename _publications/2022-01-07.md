In this paper, we propose a framework that incorporates experts diagnostics and insights into the analysis of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) using multi-modal learning. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we create a
medical diagnostic attribute dataset to improve disease classification using OCT. Although there have been successful attempts to deploy machine learning for disease classification
in OCT, such methodologies lack the experts insights. We
argue that injecting ophthalmological assessments as another
supervision in a learning framework is of great importance for
the machine learning process to perform accurate and interpretable classification. We demonstrate the proposed framework through comprehensive experiments that compare the
effectiveness of combining diagnostic attribute features with
latent visual representations and show that they surpass the
state-of-the-art approach. Finally, we analyze the proposed
dual-stream architecture and provide an insight that determine
the components that contribute most to classification performance.
